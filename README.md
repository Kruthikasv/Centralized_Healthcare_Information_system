Integrating a secure communication interface within CHIS, facilitating seamless and personalized interactions between patients and healthcare providers

The entire database implementation was carried out using MySQL, ensuring robustness and reliability. Additionally, a partial prototype was developed on the MongoDB platform to explore the feasibility of this system in a NoSQL environment. There is also an integration of the MySQL database with Python.
